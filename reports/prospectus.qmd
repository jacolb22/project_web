# Introduction

This section introduces the topic of the prospectus, its relevance, and specific research question(s) or hypothesis(es) that will be addressed.

## Literature review

### Intensificatory Tautology

The aim of the first study: "Intensificatory Tautology in the History of English: A Corpus-based Study" by Victorina González-Díaz is exploratory in nature, and concerns the development and establishment of "intensificatory tautology" which is simply intensifying the current meaning of a phrase or sentence without adding any more meaning. It focuses specifically on size-adjective clusters (phrases like "great big" and "little tiny") in the history of the English language. The findings of this study indicate that size-adjective clusters emerged in Late Middle English after a functional-structural reorganization of noun phrases. This became more productive in Early Modern English, and expanded in Present-Day English, especially in informal and spoken settings. This study used many corpora including: the PENN collection, the ARCHER corpus, the British National Corpus (BNC), the Early English Books Online (EEBO) corpus, Mandeville’s travels, and Celia Fiennes’ travelogue. The analyzing methodology was corpus-based, and used part of speech-tagged text as well as a general search for two consecutive adjectives to prune the data to a manageable level, and the rest was manually sorted through. The study also used statistical methods such as MI scores and T-tests. There is a research gap, even mentioned in the study itself, regarding how collocation interacts with word-formation processes, especially in this context. This study explains the what and where, but being exploratory in nature, it does not mention the why.

### Verb Regularity

The aim of the study "Internal and External Dynamics in Language: Evidence from Verb Regularity in a Historical Corpus of English" is to investigate the relationship between internal and external factors affecting the evolution of rules and exceptions in language, specifically focusing on the how regular the past tense verbs in American English are. The main findings of the study indicate that although the language has a continuous influx of new verbs, the overall amount of irregularity in the language remains relatively constant over time. The study used the Corpus of Historical American English (CoHA), which contains a balanced variety of written genres and more than 330 million words from the 1830–1989 period, each tagged for part of speech. The analysis approach involved a quantitative examination of factors contributing to language change, focusing on the effects of verb birth and death, as well as the regularizing or irregularizing of existing words. The study also used statistical methods to analyze the data, including the proportion of irregularity as the number of irregular past tense tokens over the total number of past tense tokens, and frequency-rank plots for different verb types in all decades. There is a research gap in that the study does not mention how certain words may change regularity over time, and whether certain words are more "volatile" than others.

### Ghanaian English Nativization

The aim of the study "Outdooring the Historical Corpus of English in Ghana" by Thorsten Brato is to compile a historical corpus of Ghanaian English (GhE) and to illustrate in real time how GhE has developed over its nativization phase. The main findings of the study indicate that GhE has been influenced by factors including: demographics, migration patterns, and language attitudes, leading to deviations from the developmental path suggested in the Dynamic Mode (I will not go into depth about the Dynamic Mode here, for more information, see the original study) . The study used the Historical Corpus of English in Ghana (HiCE Ghana), a 600,000-word corpus of GhE from the period 1966–1975, and compared it with the written-printed sections of the Ghanaian component of ICE (another corpus of GhE) to uncover how GhE has changed over the last two generations. The analysis approach involved a real-time comparison of empirical data and proposed adaptations where necessary. The study also used statistical methods to analyze the data, such as comparing data from ICE corpora of varieties which have progressed to different phases and taking an apparent-time approach to test developments within one variety. The findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the linguistic landscape in Ghana. There is a research gap in that the study does not include other postcolonial Englishes, which would help to compare the GhE findings against other similar Englishes, to see if they are consistent to other observed changes.

### Sociolinguistic Typology & Historical Corpus Linguistics

The aim of the study "Sociolinguistic Typology Meets Historical Corpus Linguistics" is to showcase how the integration of historical corpora into research methodologies can enrich our understanding of sociolinguistic typology, as highlighted by three case studies exploring potential morphosyntactic simplifications. These case studies delve into the loss of number concordance in English, changes in Latin American Spanish's null-subject system(s), and reductions in the case system in Balkan Slavic, revealing that historical corpus evidence can effectively contribute to addressing questions within sociolinguistic typology, facilitating the testing of theoretical predictions and the identification of new influencing factors. The dataset utilized in the study comprises diverse texts ranging from Middle English horse treatises to Bulgarian saints' lives to Afro-Colombian poetry, totaling over 50 texts sourced from seven countries with AHLA-speaking communities, alongside Spain as a control. The study makes use of various historical corpora such as CDE, CORDE/CDH, and CORDIAM, in addition to freely available texts from databases like Cervantes Virtual, BDH, and DLOC. Methodologically, the research adopts the "variationist" historical corpus method, which assesses the prevalence of different linguistic variants across different times and places. Statistical methods are employed to evaluate predictions, comparing texts from various times and geographical contexts. The study also addresses methodological challenges related to compiling and annotating corpora, particularly in the context of null subjects, employing techniques such as linear regression models and corpus balancing to ensure homogeneity. There is a research gap regarding the "why" behind this study, as these case studies are interesting, but this study simply shows that corpus linguistics can be used in sociolinguistic contexts. It does not show why the results are the way they are, or really what it means for each case study individually.

### Historical Corpus Analysis of the Apostrophe in Written English

The aim of the study "The night before beg’d ye queens’s pardon and his brother’s: the apostrophe in the history of English" by Javier Calle-Martín and Marta Pacheco-Franco is to investigate the standardization of the apostrophe in the English orthographic system in the period 1600–1900. The study pursues the objectives of studying the use and omission of the apostrophe in the expression of the past tense, the genitive case, and the nominative plural in the period, assessing the relationship between the three uses and their likely connections, and evaluating the likely participation of grammarians in the adoption and the rejection of each of these phenomena in English. The main findings of the study indicate that the systematic adoption of the apostrophe in the English punctuation is a late sixteenth-century development, and the symbol quickly gained in popularity and acquired a variety of functions that included the past tense (-’d), the genitive case (-’s), and the nominative plural (-’s). The study also shows that the possessive apostrophe was introduced earlier than accounted for in the literature and had spread and overcome its counterpart by the early eighteenth century. The study used the A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers (ARCHER 3.2) and the Early English Books Online corpus (EEBO) as sources of evidence. The methodology involved the extraction of data from these corpora, and the analysis of a total of 166,550 instances from ARCHER and 836,805 instances from EEBO. The study also used statistical methods to compare frequencies over time and across genres, and to normalize the data to a common base of words. The research gap lies in that the study does not note if those early uses of apostrophes had different counterparts before the introduction of the apostrophe, and if those uses have a history of being linguistically volatile. According to the way the study has presented the information and background, those uses would have had a minimum of two changes in 300 years, so it would call into question how often those uses change, and even if there are similar parallels in other languages.

### Research Statement

The research gap that I have identified regards the scope of the research in question. I believe that many of these studies explore deeply into a very specific area. This allows these studies to crawl through data that can explain the intricacies of the phenomena at hand, but does not allow the studies to see the bigger picture. More data and more varied data would allow these studies or another study to compare phenomena between languages and contexts. This could lead to new understanding of language development in context, for example. My research question, thus, is: do postcolonial languages develop new words at the same rate, or does the country's independence either slow or hasten the divergence of postcolonial language? The objectives of this research would be to answer whether or not postcolonial languages are affected by a country's independence. The expected impact of this research to expand upon the current research in this area, and to make connections between different languages and their divergence through time. Perhaps concrete stages can be developed to give a general guide about how postcolonial languages develop.

### Assessing progress

I learned how to identify a research gap, and how to craft a research question around that gap. I found it challenging to read all of the studies and analyze them, however just due to the amount of information that was new to me. I didn't consult any resources for this process, as all of the analyzing must be done by me. I do have a few questions that pertain to my research question: is it detailed enough, or too much? Is it supposed to be more connected with all 5 studies, or is it alright that I just chose one to base it off of? I will need reassurance on these questions to move forward.
